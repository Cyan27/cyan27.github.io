Abstract: Voice assistants have become prevalent on a wide range of personal devices such as smartphones and smart speakers. As companies build voice assistants with extra functionalities, attacks that trick a voice assistant into performing malicious behaviors can pose a significant threat to a user’s security, privacy, and even safety. However, the diverse attacks and stand-alone defenses in the literature often lack a systematic perspective, making it challenging for designers to properly identify, understand, and mitigate the security threats against voice assistants. To overcome this problem, this article provides a thorough survey of the attacks and countermeasures for voice assistants. We systematize a broad category of relevant but seemingly unrelated attacks by the vulnerable system components and attack methods, and categorize existing countermeasures based on the defensive strategies from a system designer’s perspective. To assist designers in planning defense based on their demands, we provide a qualitative comparison of existing countermeasures by the implementation cost, usability, and security and propose practical suggestions. We envision this work can help build more reliability into voice assistants and promote research in this fast-evolving area.
